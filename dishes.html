        <p>Here at MetroState Animal Shelter Dishes are a never ending task. Do the potential of disease transfer among animals, we only use stainless steel bowls that can be sanitized. Handwashing with soap and hot water is not enough. You will need to follow these steps to ensure the animals health at MAS.</p>
        <h3>Steps to Sanitize Dishes</h3>
        <p>1. You will start by scraping left over food into the garbage. Just like at home the more food gunk not going down the drain the better. </p>
        <p>2. Use hot water and dish detergent. Use your sink and fill it with hot soapy water, then wash the dishes. As you work, transfer the washed dishes to the other half of your sink filled with clean water. </p>
        <p>3. Rinse the Dishes with clean water. Drop the soapy dishes into the rinse water. They can stay there while you mix up the bleach and water solution.</p>
        <p>4. Clean out the wash tub and fill with clean water. Fill roughly halfway then add 2tablespoons of Bleach. If the bleach botten has a pump top: use 1 pump. </p>
        <p>5. Sanitize the Dishes. Add Clean rinsed dishes to the bleach solution. Allow to soak completely submerged for 2 minutes. </p>
        <p>6. Dishes can be placed on the drying rack, there is no need to rinse. </p>

        <h3>Thank you for doing the Dishes. </h3>
