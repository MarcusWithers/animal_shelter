        <p>Not every animal that comes to MetroState Animal Shelter is Healthy. Many require time in the Sick wards to make sure they are perfectly healthy prior to adoption. Working along side our Veterinary Services Team you can make a huge difference. </p>

        <h3>How to help </h3>
        <br>
        
        <p>Washing your hands between each animal, give each one a little 'out of kennel time' as well as any attention they may want.
            This may mean no physical connect or lap snuggling on the chair. Allow each animal to perform whatever activity they feel like it during their TLC time </p>
